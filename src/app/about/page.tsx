            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Hi! I’m Rahul Sharma, a music teacher by heart and a digital marketer by passion.</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>For years, I’ve enjoyed teaching students how to express themselves through music. But recently, I’ve found a new rhythm — in the world of SEO and digital marketing. </p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>I’m currently exploring how the digital world works — learning everything from how websites rank on Google to how social media can grow a brand. As a beginner in this exciting field, I bring curiosity, dedication, and a creative perspective to everything I do.</p>

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4'>Why Digital Marketing?</h2>
            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>As a music teacher, I’ve always loved connecting with people and helping them grow — and I realized that digital marketing is just another way to do that, but online.</p>

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4'>Now, I’m learning and working on projects that involve:</h2>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Basic SEO (like keyword research and on-page optimization)</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Social Media Content Creation</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Creating user-friendly websites and content</p>

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4'>What I’m Learning</h2>
            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>I’m currently sharpening my skills through:</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Online courses (Udemy and YouTube)</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Real projects (helping friends and small businesses with social media and SEO)</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>Trying out tools like Canva, Google Analytics, and WordPress</p>

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4'>My Goal</h2>
            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>My aim is to grow as a digital marketer, help others build their online presence, and combine creativity with strategy — whether that’s for a music class or a local business.</p>

            <p className='text-lg mb-4'>I’m also interested in helping artists, musicians, and educators use digital tools to reach more people and share their work online.</p>
